<h2>1986-2004 Overview</h2>
<p>The period from 1986 to 2004 saw a significant increase in the national debt as a percentage of GDP. This increase was largely driven by the economic policies of the Reagan and Bush administrations, which included tax cuts and increased defense spending. By the end of this period, the debt-to-GDP ratio had risen to around 60%.
</p>
<p>The tax cuts enacted during this period, particularly the Tax Reform Act of 1986, reduced government revenues and contributed to the growth of the national debt. At the same time, defense spending increased significantly, further driving up the debt. Despite these challenges, the economy grew steadily during this period, helped by a series of economic reforms and technological advancements.</p>

<h2>Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1999) Impact</h2>
<p>The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1999, like the Latin American Debt Crisis, had an indirect impact on the U.S. national debt. The crisis began in Thailand with the financial collapse of the Thai baht after the government was forced to float the baht due to lack of foreign currency to support its fixed exchange rate, cutting its peg to the U.S. dollar. As the crisis spread, many Asian countries experienced a decline in values of their currencies, stock markets, and other asset prices.</p>
<p>This crisis led to a slowdown in global economic growth, which could have potentially reduced U.S. export revenues and led to lower tax revenues. However, the U.S. economy was relatively resilient during this period, and the impact on the U.S. national debt was likely limited.</p>
