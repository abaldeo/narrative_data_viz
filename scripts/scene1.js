                    <h2>1966-1985 Overview</h2>
                <p>The period between 1966 and 1985 was characterized by a steady growth in the national debt, but not at a
                    particularly alarming rate. During these years, the national debt as a percentage of GDP remained relatively
                    stable, with a slight upward trend. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a measure of a country's ability to pay
                    down its debt, hovered around 30-40% during most of this period </p>
                <p>This period was marked by a series of economic policies aimed at boosting economic growth and managing
                    inflation.
                    Despite these efforts, the national debt continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in subsequent
                    years. The growth in national debt during this period can be attributed to a combination of factors,
                    including
                    the Vietnam War, the oil shock of the 1970s, and the economic policies of the Reagan administration in the
                    early
                    1980s, which prioritized tax cuts and increased military spending </p>
                <h2>1973 Oil Crisis Impact</h2>
                <p>The oil crisis of 1973 had a significant impact on the U.S. economy, but its effect on the national debt was
                    not as direct as the world wars or the Great Depression. The oil crisis led to increased inflation and
                    economic instability, which indirectly affected government revenues and spending, but overall the debt did not increase. </p>
            
                <h2>1980s Latin American Debt Crisis Impact</h2>
                <p>The Latin American Debt Crisis of the 1980s, also known as the "lost decade," had indirect effects on the
                    U.S. national debt. During the 1970s, U.S. banks had significantly increased their lending to Latin American
                    countries. However, economic events such as oil price shocks and global inflation led to a situation where
                    these countries were unable to repay their debts
                </p>
                <p>When the crisis hit in 1982, many U.S. banks faced significant losses, with the nine largest U.S. banks
                    holding Latin American debt amounting to 176 percent of their capital. This crisis in the banking
                    sector started to increase the U.S. national debt significantly, as the government had needed to
                    intervene to stabilize the financial system.</p>
