<h2>2005-2023 Overview</h2>
<p>The years from 2005 to 2023 witnessed an unprecedented increase in the US national debt as a percentage of GDP. This period was marked by two significant events that led to a substantial increase in government spending: the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2022, the national debt had surged to over $30 trillion, with the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 100%.</p>

<p>The response to the Great Recession involved significant fiscal stimulus measures, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). These measures, combined with the reduction in tax revenues due to the recession, led to a sharp increase in the national debt.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the national debt situation. The government implemented several relief packages to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, resulting in an additional increase in the national debt. Despite the sharp increase in the debt, interest payments as a percentage of GDP remained relatively low, thanks to historically low interest rates.</p>

<h2>Great Recession (2007-2009) Impact</h2>
<p>The Great Recession, which started in 2007 and ended in 2009, was the most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression. The recession was triggered by a financial crisis that led to the collapse of large financial institutions and a downturn in stock markets around the world.</p>

<p>To combat the financial crisis and the ensuing recession, the U.S. government implemented a series of fiscal stimulus measures, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). These measures increased government spending significantly, which, combined with a decrease in tax revenues due to the recession, led to a sharp increase in the national debt.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus Pandemic (2019-2023) Impact</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the U.S. economy and the national debt. In response to the pandemic, the U.S. government passed several relief packages aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic. These measures have resulted in a significant increase in government spending.</p>

<p>Since the start of the pandemic in 2019, the U.S. national debt has increased sharply. By June 2020, the national debt had increased by $2.5 trillion or 11.5 percentage points of GDP. This increase was primarily due to the federal bills passed to address the pandemic and mitigate the economic fallout of business shutdowns.</p>


<p>In conclusion, both the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic have had significant impacts on the U.S. national debt as a percentage of GDP, primarily due to increased government spending in response to these crises.</p>
